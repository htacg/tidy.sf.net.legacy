    <h2>
      Patterns
    </h2>
    <p>
      glimpse supports a large variety of patterns, including simple strings,
      strings with classes of characters, sets of strings, wild cards, and
      regular expressions (see <a href="#Limitations">Limitations</a>).
    </p>
    <h3>
      Strings
    </h3>
    <p>
      Strings are any sequence of characters, including the special symbols `^'
      for beginning of line and `$' for end of line. The following special
      characters (`$', `^', `*', `[', `^', `|', `(', `)', `!', and `\' ) as
      well as the following meta characters special to glimpse (and agrep):
      `;', `,', `#', `&gt;', `&lt;', `-', and `.', should be preceded by `\\'
      if they are to be matched as regular characters. For example, \\^abc\\\\
      corresponds to the string ^abc\\, whereas ^abc corresponds to the string
      abc at the beginning of a line.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Classes of characters
    </h3>
    <p>
      a list of characters inside [] (in order) corresponds to any character
      from the list. For example, [a-ho-z] is any character between a and h or
      between o and z. The symbol `^' inside [] complements the list. For
      example, [^i-n] denote any character in the character set except
      character 'i' to 'n'. The symbol `^' thus has two meanings, but this is
      consistent with egrep. The symbol `.' (don't care) stands for any symbol
      (except for the newline symbol).
    </p>
    <h3>
      Boolean operations
    </h3>
    <p>
      Glimpse supports an `AND' operation denoted by the symbol `;' an `OR'
      operation denoted by the symbol `,', a limited version of a 'NOT'
      operation (starting at version 4.0B1) denoted by the symbol `~', or any
      combination. For example, pizza;cheeseburger' will output all lines
      containing both patterns. '{political,computer};science' will match
      'political science' or 'science of computers'.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Wild cards
    </h3>
    <p>
      The symbol '#' is used to denote a sequence of any number (including 0)
      of arbitrary characters (see <a href="#Limitations">Limitations</a>). The
      symbol # is equivalent to .* in egrep. In fact, .* will work too, because
      it is a valid regular expression (see below), but unless this is part of
      an actual regular expression, # will work faster. (Currently glimpse is
      experiencing some problems with #.)
    </p>
    <h3>
      Combination of exact and approximate matching
    </h3>
    <p>
      Any pattern inside angle brackets &lt;&gt; must match the text exactly
      even if the match is with errors. For example, &lt;mathemat&gt;ics
      matches mathematical with one error (replacing the last s with an a), but
      mathe&lt;matics&gt; does not match mathematical no matter how many errors
      are allowed. (This option is buggy at the moment.)
    </p>
    <h3>
      Regular expressions
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since the index is word based, a regular expression must match words that
      appear in the index for glimpse to find it. Glimpse first strips the
      regular expression from all non-alphabetic characters, and searches the
      index for all remaining words. It then applies the regular expression
      matching algorithm to the files found in the index. For example, glimpse
      'abc.*xyz' will search the index for all files that contain both 'abc'
      and 'xyz', and then search directly for 'abc.*xyz' in those files. (If
      you use glimpse -w 'abc.*xyz', then 'abcxyz' will not be found, because
      glimpse will think that abc and xyz need to be matches to whole words.)
      The syntax of regular expressions in glimpse is in general the same as
      that for agrep. The union operation `|', Kleene closure `*', and
      parentheses () are all supported. Currently '+' is not supported. Regular
      expressions are currently limited to approximately 30 characters
      (generally excluding meta characters). The maximal number of errors for
      regular expressions that use '*' or '|' is 4.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      Limitations
    </h2>
    <p>
      The index of glimpse is word based. A pattern that contains more than one
      word cannot be found in the index. The way glimpse overcomes this
      weakness is by splitting any multi-word pattern into its set of words and
      looking for all of them in the index. For example, <i>'linear
      programming'</i> will first consult the index to find all files
      containing both <i>linear</i> and <i>programming</i>, and then apply
      agrep to find the combined pattern. This is usually an effective
      solution, but it can be slow for cases where both words are very common,
      but their combination is not.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was mentioned in the section on <a href="#Patterns">Patterns</a>
      above, some characters serve as meta characters for glimpse and need to
      be preceded by '\\' to search for them. The most common examples are the
      characters '.' (which stands for a wild card), and '*' (the Kleene
      closure). So, "glimpse ab.de" will match abcde, but "glimpse ab\\.de"
      will not, and "glimpse ab*de" will not match ab*de, but "glimpse ab\\*de"
      will. The meta character - is translated automatically to a hypen unless
      it appears between [] (in which case it denotes a range of characters).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no size limit for simple patterns and simple patterns within
      Boolean expressions. More complicated patterns, such as regular
      expressions, are currently limited to approximately 30 characters. Lines
      are limited to 1024 characters.
