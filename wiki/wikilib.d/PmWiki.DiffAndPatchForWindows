text=Revisions in PmWiki uses the unix commands @@diff@@ and @@patch@@, therefore revisions turn up blank running PmWiki under Windows.²²Here are the solutions to this missing utility issue.²²!!!1) The WinDiff package.²Difficulty Level: 1 out of 5²²See PmWiki.WinDiff.²²!!!2) Installing required utilities from gnuwin32 project.²Difficulty Level: 2 out of 5²²# Visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/²# Click on the two packages you will need ('''diffutils''', and '''patch''')²# Be sure to download the Win-32 .EXE and not the .ZIP (Zip doesn't contain setup files).²# Install the packages²# Add these two lines to your ''config.php'' file:²    [=²    $SysDiffCmd = 'C:\\"Program Files"\\GnuWin32\\bin\\diff';²    $SysPatchCmd = 'C:\\"Program Files"\\GnuWin32\\bin\\patch --silent'; =]²²->I found that sometimes the path name "Progrram Files" doesn't work well, but when I copy the GnuWin32 tools to a more simple directory (include no space), e.g.:  [=D:\\GnuWin32\\bin=]. Then all of these works well. --Elias Soong²²->Try using the path '''[=C:\\PROGRA~1\\GNUWIN32\\BIN=]''' instead. --{{para-dice}}²²!!!3) Installing minimal cygwin environment to get utilities from.²Difficulty Level: 3 out of 5²²I had some problems getting the gnuwin32 utilities to work.²Installed a minimal cygwin ( http://www.cygwin.com ) with @@diff-utils@@ and @@patch@@ packages included, works great for me now.² [=²$SysDiffCmd = 'C:\cygwin\bin\diff.exe';²$SysPatchCmd = 'C:\cygwin\bin\patch.exe --silent'; =]²Ta da again! -- JoNtE²²!!!4) Running Apache + PHP + PmWiki entirely from cygwin environment.²Difficulty Level: 4 out of 5²²If you run the Apache/PHP combo that comes with cygwin ( http://www.cygwin.com ), Then you don't need to specify the @@$SysDiffCmd@@ or @@$SysPatchCmd@@ variables as PmWiki will function thinking it's under a unix environment.  ²²Don't forget to manually select the @@diff-utils@@ and @@patch@@ packages when performing the cygwin install.²²-> %note% Note: This is not the same as using the win32 Apache install from http://httpd.apache.org/, or the win32 installer from http://www.php.net/.²²Re Ta Da! --JoakimErdfelt²²-> my host doesnt allow system command :( Is there a diff.php command that give the same output and might be used instead ? :0)  AsharVoultoiz²²Try Cookbook.PHPDiffEngine²²NilsK²²
