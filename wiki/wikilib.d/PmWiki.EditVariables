text=<<|{{Variables}}|>>께The variables listed on this page affect editing and saving of text to pages.께:$DefaultPageTextFmt:The text that should be displayed when editing or browsing non-existent pages.  May also appear in other contexts, such as when a non-existent page is included via @@[=[[include:PageName]]=]@@.        $DefaultPageTextFmt = 'Page $Tlink does not exist';께:$DiffKeepDays:The minimum number of days to keep a page's revision history.  Defaults to 3650 (a little less than ten years).께:$DeleteKeyWord:The string that indicates a page should be deleted.  Defaults to 'delete'.께:$SysDiffCmd:The path to an external program that performs the equivalent of GNU's ''diff(1)'' program for maintaining PageHistory.  Defaults to @@/usr/bin/diff@@, but may need to be changed on systems where ''diff(1)'' is in a different location (e.g., when running on [[WinDiff Windows servers]]) or is encumbered by PHPSafeMode.  Setting this to an empty string disables PageHistory.        $SysDiffCmd='/usr/bin/diff';      # default        $SysDiffCmd='';                   # disable page history        # The following is used by WinDiff        $SysDiffCmd='windiff\\diff';        # Sometimes a workaround for PHPSafeMode        $SysDiffCmd='./diff';께:$SysPatchCmd:The path to an external program that performs the equivalent of GNU's ''patch(1)'' program for merging ''diff's''.  Defaults to @@"/usr/bin/patch --silent"@@, but may need to be changed on systems where ''patch(1)'' is somewhere else.  Setting this to an empty string disables the "Restore" feature of PageHistory.        $SysPatchCmd = '';                # disable restore        # The following is used by WinDiff        $SysPatchCmd='windiff\\patch --silent';께:$DiffFunction::$PatchFunction:: :The names of the PHP functions to be called to generate/restore page history information.  Defaults to PmWiki's internal "Diff" and "Patch" functions, but these can be changed to allow a user to create customized diff/patch capabilities. This is used by the Cookbook.PHPDiffEngine.께:$RecentChanges:An array containing the page names and text format lines to be used to save RecentChanges information.께:$EnablePostAuthorRequired:If set to a non-zero value, then authors are required to provide a name in the "Author" field of the edit form before changes may be saved to a page.께:$AuthorRequiredFmt:The message displayed above the edit form when $EnablePostAuthorRequired is set and an author has failed to provide a name in the "Author" field.께
