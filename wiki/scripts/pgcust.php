    This script enables per-page and per-group customizations in the
    local/ subdirectory.  For example, to create customizations for
    the 'Demo' group, place them in a file called local/Demo.php.
    To customize a single page, use the full page name (e.g., 
    local/Demo.MyPage.php).  Customizations in the default group
    are automatically loaded if neither a per-page or per-group 
    customization file exists.

    Per-group customizations can be handled at any time by adding
	include_once("scripts/pgcust.php");
    to config.php.  It is automatically included by scripts/stdconfig.php
    unless $EnablePerGroupCust is set to zero in local.php.
