About tidy.sf.net
-----------------

Ever since Dave Raggett open-sourced HTML Tidy it’s been living at
[tidy.sf.net][1], and in fact it’s still the top hit in most search engines
when seeking “html tidy.”

Although HTACG is the current maintainer of _canonical_ HTML Tidy it took a few
steps and ownership changes to make this happen. As a result HTML Tidy is
currently hosted on [github][2], as are our [HTACG][4] and [HTML Tidy][3]
websites. However there is still significant interest in maintaining the
“legacy” site, and doing so limits the confusion that there are multiple forks
of HTML Tidy.
